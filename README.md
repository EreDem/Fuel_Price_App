# Fuel_Price_App
A React Native app designed to help users find the best time windows to refuel, based on predictions from a custom multilayer perceptron I built from scratch in Python. The app connects to the modelâ€™s output to provide simple, data-driven insights in an intuitive interface. Built with Expo as part of my ongoing learning journey in machine learning.
